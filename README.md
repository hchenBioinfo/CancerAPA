# Pan-cancer GWAS APA analysis
Resources and analysis shared by ["A distinct class of pan-cancer susceptibility genes revealed by alternative polyadenylation transcriptome-wide association study"](https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2023.02.28.23286554v1)
# Introduction
In this study, we performed the first large-scale and systematic analysis assessing the genetic effects of APA on 25 cancer types in 49 human tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression(GTEx).
# Data Resources
* GWAS fine-mapping using [CAUSALdb](https://github.com/mulinlab/CAUSALdb-finemapping-pip)
* GWAS heritabiltiy estimates and genetic correlaiton using [LDSC](https://github.com/bulik/ldsc)
* 3aQTL calling and fine-mapping using [CAVIAR](https://github.com/fhormoz/caviar)
* GWAS and 3aQTL integration
  * heritablity enrichment esitimate using 
  * coloc(https://github.com/chr1swallace/coloc)
  * SMR
  * TWAS
